    "## **What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?**\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\"—which can contain data (attributes) and code (methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP helps us design code that is **modular**, **reusable**, and **easier to understand**, especially for large projects."

    "## **Hard to Understand? Let’s Use a Real-World Example!**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say you are building a neighborhood full of houses:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Every house follows a **blueprint**—the design plan. This is your **class**.\n",
    "2. When a house is built using that blueprint, it becomes an **actual house**—this is your **object**.\n",
    "3. Each house can have **different colors and number of rooms**, but all follow the same structure.\n",
    "4. Similarly in OOP, a **class** defines what kind of data and behaviors the objects will have.\n",
    "5. When you create an object, you're building a specific house from the blueprint.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Python, OOP allows us to reuse code by defining classes and using them to create multiple objects easily.**"

    "In our real-world analogy, the **class** is like the blueprint of a house. It defines the structure and design but does not represent an actual house. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- A blueprint specifies that every house will have a **door**, **windows**, and **rooms**.\n",
    "- However, the blueprint itself is not a house—it is just a plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, in Python, a **class** defines the structure and behavior (methods) that its objects will have, but it does not represent an actual object until you create one. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "An **object** is a specific instance of a class. When you create an object, you are essentially building something based on the blueprint (class).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- If the class is a blueprint for a house, the object is the actual house built from that blueprint.\n",
    "- Each object can have its own unique properties (e.g., color, size) while following the structure defined by the class.\n",

    "### **1️⃣ Create a Simple Class and Object**\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a Python class named `Person` with two attributes: `name` and `age`.\n",
    "Create an object of this class and print the name and age of the person.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 **Example Output:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Name: Alice  \n",
    "Age: 30\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2️⃣ Add a Method to a Class**\n",
    "\n",
    "Extend the `Person` class by adding a method called `greet()` that prints a greeting message including the person's name.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 **Example Output:**\n",

    "```\n",
    "Hello, my name is Alice!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3️⃣ Implement a Constructor (`__init__` method)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Modify the `Person` class to include a constructor (`__init__`) that initializes the `name` and `age` attributes when a new object is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 **Example Usage:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "person = Person(\"Bob\", 25)\n",
    "print(person.name)  \n",
    "print(person.age)   \n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4️⃣ Create Multiple Objects**\n",
    "\n",
    "Create multiple objects of the `Person` class with different names and ages. Print their attributes to verify each object holds its own data.\n",

    "Name: Alice, Age: 30  \n",
    "Name: Bob, Age: 25  \n",
    "Name: Charlie, Age: 40\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
