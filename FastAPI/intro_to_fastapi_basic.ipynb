    "\n",
    "**FastAPI** is a modern, fast web framework for building APIs with Python. It's designed to be easy to use and learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key features of FastAPI include:\n",
    "- **Fast**: One of the fastest Python frameworks available\n",
    "- **Easy to learn**: Simple and intuitive for beginners\n",
    "- **Automatic documentation**: Creates interactive API documentation for you\n",
    "- **Type hints**: Uses Python type hints for validation\n",
    "- **Modern**: Based on Python 3.6+ features"

    "## FastAPI: A Real-World Analogy\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand what FastAPI does, let's use a restaurant analogy:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you've created an amazing AI model (like the ones we worked with in our previous lecture). This AI model is like a talented chef in a kitchen who can create delicious dishes (generate text, analyze images, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "**The problem**: How do customers (users) order food from your chef? They can't just walk into the kitchen and talk directly to the chef!\n",
    "\n",
    "**The solution**: You need waiters who can:\n",
    "1. Take orders from customers (receive requests from users)\n",
    "2. Deliver those orders to the chef (send requests to your AI model)\n",
    "3. Bring the prepared dishes back to the customers (return the AI model's responses)\n",
    "\n",
    "**FastAPI is like the waiter for your AI restaurant:**\n",
    "- It takes requests from users\n",
    "- It sends those requests to your code\n",
    "- It returns the responses back to users\n",
    "\n",
    "Without this waiter (FastAPI), your amazing chef (AI model) would be inaccessible to customers (users)!"

    "## Why Do We Need APIs for Our AI Projects?\n",
    "\n",
    "In our previous lecture, we learned how to use AI APIs to generate text, answer questions, and more. But what if we want to create our own application that uses these AI capabilities?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's why we need to create our own APIs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Integration**: APIs allow our AI models to be used in any application (web apps, mobile apps)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Accessibility**: Users can access our AI models without needing to understand the code\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Scalability**: APIs can handle multiple requests from different users\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Security**: We can control access to our AI models and protect sensitive information\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at a real-world example: ChatGPT. OpenAI has created a web interface (chat.openai.com) where users can interact with their AI models. But they also provide an API (which we used in our previous lecture) so developers can build their own applications using the same technology."
