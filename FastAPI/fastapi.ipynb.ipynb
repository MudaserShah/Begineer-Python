    "## Understanding HTTP Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "When building web APIs, we use different **HTTP methods** (also called verbs) to tell the server what kind of action we want to perform on a specific resource (like a piece of data). Think of them as instructions for the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "FastAPI makes it easy to handle these methods using decorators. The most common methods you'll encounter are:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **GET:** This is used to request data from the server. When you visit a webpage in your browser, you're usually making a GET request. In API terms, it's used to retrieve information, like getting details about a specific user or a list of items.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **POST:** This method is typically used to send data to the server to create a new resource. For example, when you fill out a sign-up form or submit a new blog post, you're often sending a POST request.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **PUT:** This method is generally used to update an existing resource completely. If you want to change all the details of a user profile, you might use a PUT request, sending the full updated profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **DELETE:** As the name suggests, this method is used to request the server to delete a specific resource. For instance, deleting a user account or removing an item from a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "FastAPI provides decorators like `@app.get(\"/path\")`, `@app.post(\"/path\")`, `@app.put(\"/path\")`, and `@app.delete(\"/path\")` to handle these different request types easily."

    "### Running the HTTP Method Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "We have separate files demonstrating each method. You need to run each file individually from your terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. GET Example ([`get_example.py`](./get_example.py))**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Open your terminal, navigate to the directory containing the files, and run:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     python get_example.py\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. You should see the welcome message.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. POST Example ([`post_example.py`](./post_example.py))**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Run the file (it uses port 8001):\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     python post_example.py\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Since POST requests send data, you can't easily test this with just a browser URL. Use the interactive API docs:\n",
    "     - Go to `http://127.0.0.1:8001/docs` in your browser.\n",
    "     - Find the POST `/items/` endpoint, click \"Try it out\", fill in the example request body, and click \"Execute\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. PUT Example ([`put_example.py`](./put_example.py))**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Run the file (it uses port 8002):\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     python put_example.py\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Similar to POST, use the API docs at `http://127.0.0.1:8002/docs`.\n",
    "   - Find the PUT `/items/{item_id}` endpoint. Try updating item `1` by entering `1` in the `item_id` field, providing the request body, and executing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. DELETE Example ([`delete_example.py`](./delete_example.py))**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Run the file (it uses port 8003):\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     python delete_example.py\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Use the API docs at `http://127.0.0.1:8003/docs`.\n",
    "   - Find the DELETE `/items/{item_id}` endpoint. Try deleting item `1` by entering `1` for `item_id` and executing.\n",
    "   - You can then use the GET `/items/` endpoint in the same docs to see that item 1 is gone."

    "## Working with Path Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, you need to identify a specific item or resource directly in the URL path. For example, if you want to get information about a user with ID `123`, your URL might look like `/users/123`. That `123` part is a **path parameter**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In FastAPI, you define path parameters using curly braces `{}` directly in the path string of your decorator (e.g., `@app.get(\"/items/{item_id}\")`). FastAPI automatically recognizes this and lets you use the parameter name (like `item_id`) as an argument in your path operation function. You can also specify the data type for the parameter (like `int` or `str`) using Python type hints, and FastAPI will handle data validation for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# From path_param_example.py\n",
    "@app.get(\"/users/{user_id}\")\n",
    "def get_user_by_id(user_id: int):\n",
    "    # ... function body ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, `user_id` is a path parameter expected to be an integer."

    "### Running the Path Parameter Example\n",
    "\n",
    "(Associated file: [`path_param_example.py`](./path_param_example.py))\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Run the file (it uses port 8004):\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     python path_param_example.py\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Test it by visiting URLs with different IDs in your browser:\n",
    "     - `http://127.0.0.1:8004/users/1`\n",
    "     - `http://127.0.0.1:8004/users/2`\n",
    "     - `http://127.0.0.1:8004/users/99` (This should give a 'Not Found' error).\n",

    "## Using Query Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "**Query parameters** are another way to send data to the server, but they are not part of the main URL path. Instead, they appear at the end of the URL after a question mark `?`, as key-value pairs separated by ampersands `&`. They are often used for filtering, sorting, or pagination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example URL with query parameters: `/items?skip=0&limit=10`\n",
    "Here, `skip` and `limit` are query parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In FastAPI, any function parameter declared in your path operation function that is *not* part of the path parameters is automatically interpreted as a query parameter. You can define their types and default values just like regular Python function arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# From query_param_example.py\n",
    "from typing import Union\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.get(\"/items/\")\n",
    "def read_items(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, q: Union[str, None] = None):\n",
    "    # ... function body ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, `skip`, `limit`, and `q` are query parameters. `skip` and `limit` have default values, while `q` is optional (can be `None`). FastAPI handles extracting these values from the URL if they are provided."

    "## Organizing Your Code with FastAPI Routers\n",
    "\n",
    "As your API grows larger, putting all your path operations (like `@app.get`, `@app.post`, etc.) into a single file can become messy and hard to manage. Imagine having dozens or even hundreds of endpoints in one file! To keep things organized, FastAPI provides a powerful feature called **APIRouter**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of an `APIRouter` as a mini-FastAPI application. You can define path operations, dependencies, and even other routers within it, just like you do with the main `FastAPI` app. The key benefit is that you can group related endpoints together in separate Python modules (files).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you might have one router for handling user-related operations (like creating users, getting user details) and another router for handling item-related operations (like adding items, listing items). This makes your codebase much cleaner and easier to navigate.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use a router, you first import `APIRouter` from `fastapi`. Then, you create an instance of it, similar to how you create your main `FastAPI` instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# From router_items.py\n",
    "from fastapi import APIRouter\n",
    "\n",
    "router = APIRouter()\n",
    "\n",
    "@router.get(\"/\")\n",
    "def read_items():\n",
    "    # ... function body ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how we use `@router.get` instead of `@app.get`. You define your path operations on the router instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have defined your path operations in a separate file using an `APIRouter`, you need to tell your main FastAPI application to include this router. You do this using the `app.include_router()` method in your main application file (`main.py` in our example):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# From router_main.py\n",
    "from fastapi import FastAPI\n",
    "from routers import items # Import the router module\n",
    "\n",
    "app = FastAPI()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Include the router with a prefix and tags\n",
    "app.include_router(items.router, prefix=\"/items\", tags=[\"items\"])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you include a router, you can also specify a `prefix` (like `/items`) which will be added before all paths defined in that router, and `tags` which help group the endpoints in the automatic API documentation (like Swagger UI).\n",
    "\n",
    "Using routers is a fundamental practice for building maintainable and scalable FastAPI applications."

    "### Running the Router Example\n",
    "\n",
    "This example involves two files: [`router_main.py`](./router_main.py) (main application) and [`router_items.py`](./router_items.py) (items router).\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Important:** Both files are in the current directory. Run the main application file (`router_main.py`):\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Important:** Navigate your terminal *inside* the `router_example` directory:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Run the main application file (it uses port 8006):\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     python router_main.py \n",
    "     # Or use: uvicorn router_main:app --reload --port 8006\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Test the endpoints:\n",
    "     - Main app root: `http://127.0.0.1:8006/`\n",
    "     - Items router root: `http://127.0.0.1:8006/items/`\n",
    "     - Specific item via router: `http://127.0.0.1:8006/items/item1`\n",
